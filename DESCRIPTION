Description: We introduce an R package to performe evolutionary model-based simulation approach that allows
    to estimate the influence of stabilizing selection along the macroevolutionary dynamics of a given lineage
    on niche-based species sorting across sets of local communities, and its consequence for species diversity gradients.
    The package used AIC algorithm to select the evolutionary model that present the greater evidence. The metacommunity
    simulation is made through the use of McSim functions. See McSim package for more information.
