Description: We introduce mcfly, an R package to perform evolutionary model-based simulation approach that allows
    to estimate the influence of stabilizing selection on niche-based species sorting of a given lineage
    distributed across sets of local communities (a metacommunity).
    mcfly package use an ABC (Aproximate Bayesian Computation) coupled with an individual based simulation model algorithm to infer the force of evolutionary 
    stabilizing selection that present the most prabability to
    generate the diversity gradient observed in the metacommunity analized. The simulation producedure is made through the use of MCSim functions.
    See MCSim package for more information on individual based model.
